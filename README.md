Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass is wanting to provide customers with an ability to learn and practice for drivers tests in an online environment. The application should keep track of each studentsâ€™ progress for each lesson and test to help give a better learning experience. Because driving requirements change often, the application needs to be maintained to provide current testing questions and information in relation to DMV standards. To help with education, customers should be able to schedule hands-on learning sessions with a student driver. These sessions should be bundled into packages that can be modified by a system administrator. The scheduled sessions should be able to be changed by customers to best fit their needs.

What did you do particularly well? 

Within this project, a multitude of charts and diagrms needed to be made to better help with the application's design. The charts and diagrams that I have created do a good job of explaining the inner workings of the system.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 

I would redo my Use Case diagram. The diagram that has been made is not as detailed as I would like it to be. It does not include everything that the users are able to do. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I design software mainly by following an agile model working within a SCRUM team. The project is broken down into smaller parts and devided between the strengths of the team members.
